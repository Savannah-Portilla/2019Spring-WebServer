#I graduated from Ithaca college in 2016 with a BA in Biology. It took me two years following my graduation to figure out what it was that I really wanted to do with my life. What I knew – all my life I had been an artist, puzzle solver, builder, crafter and what I like to call a “tinker”. It was about a year and a half ago at this point that I discovered programming (even my generation wasn’t exposed to it growing up). Soon after this grand discovery I decided to go for it and apply to the SUNY New Paltz Computer Science Master’s Program. Last semester was my very first semester, and really, my first real encounter with programming – I entered the program as a complete beginner. Even though I knew nothing, I pushed and worked hard to get good grades and take in as much as I possibly could, and as difficult as it was, I absolutely loved it. Last semester I took Object Oriented Programming (JAVA), Computer Systems, and Database Design (although, to be honest, we didn’t learn much beyond Crow’s Foot Notation and some simple MySQL queries). I learned a great deal in the other two courses however, with a main focus in small and simple programming assignments in JAVA and assembly language. 

#Web Server Programming is the course that I have been most eager to take. My dream is to work for a company in which I can develop beautiful and engaging web applications and mobile apps. The Intuit company really inspired me with its stunning and simple to use web and mobile apps such as Mint and Turbo Tax. This is what I want to do, and so, I am SO excited for this course and hope I can take what we learn with me to my future career!!!
